<h1>Tuwatch</h1>
<p>Tuwatch is a movie search engine that helps the user to be able to search for a movie. The user prompts out the name of the movie in need and the search algorithm will scan through on the tmdb database to look for the movie that the user has prompted.</p>

<h2>idea behind it</h2>
<p>well, ever been in a case where youre not sure if a person recommending you the movie is saying exactly whats in the movie? or maybe just getting you offtrack to what the main content of the movie is about? <br> well,
thats somehow purposely the reason for this service. A user gets to search out the movie that they want to be looked up on and then they get back a variety of films in place. they get back a summarized description of the movies brought by the tmdb algorithm and also their rotten tomatoes ratings and as  an addition, an agreeable movie poster for the same movies queried in place. perfect for movie recommendation and reveiwing.</p>
